# RayleighFitting

Here we show how a mobile propagation measurement could be processed. More, in detail information is contained in RayleighFitting.pdf.

We provide an example file (.mat) corresponding to a continuous wave, CW, RF signal assumed to be received under Rayleigh fading conditions. 

We present a way of preprocessing the supplied time series and how to fit it to a Rayleigh distribution and to an exponential distribution. We also perform a chi-square goodness of fit test.

The supplied data and Matlab scripts and functions are in directory SW.
